This repository contains the code and instructions necessary to reproduce
the data analyses of the [STW][stw]-funded project [BATMAN][batman]. The 
BATMAN project also involves several side projects, e.g. the `psvu` and 
`ontj` studies. 

In the documentation that follows we will assume a Linux-like OS, and that
the BATMAN dataset is managed by [somsds][somsds] data management system.
This is the case if you are trying to reproduce the data analyses at
the `somerengrid` (our lab's private computing grid).
