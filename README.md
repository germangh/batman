This repository contains the code and instructions necessary to reproduce
the data analyses of the [STW][stw]-funded project [BATMAN][batman]. 

In the documentation that follows we will assume a Linux-like OS, and that 
the BATMAN dataset is managed by [somsds][somsds] data management system. 
This is the case if you are trying to reproduce the data analyses at 
the `somerengrid` (our lab's private computing grid).

The table below lists all the analyses and processing tasks that have been
 perfomed on the BATMAN dataset so far, roughtly in chronological order.
