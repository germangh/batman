Extraction of HRV features
======


## Single file analyses 

Assuming you are working at the `somerengrid`, you only need to run the 
following code to perform the HRV feature extraction:

````matlab
% Make meegpipe functionality available
close all; clear all; clear classes;
restoredefaultpath;
addpath(genpath('/data1/toolbox/meegpipe'));
meegpipe.initialize;

% Run the HRV feature extraction script
pupillator.hrv.main;
````

The feature extraction is implemented as a [meegpipe][meegpipe] pipeline. 
The actual pipeline is defined in [pupillator.pipes.hrv_analysis][hrv-pipe]. 

[meegpipe]: http://github.com/meegpipe/meegpipe
[hrv-pipe]: ./+pipes/hrv_analysis.m

The HRV features are extracted with the help of the [HRV toolkit][hrv-toolkit]. 
See the corresponding [documentation][hrv-toolkit] for a description of all 
extracted features.

[hrv-toolkit]: http://physionet.org/tutorials/hrv-toolkit/

The feature extraction reports for each data file will be stored under 
`/data1/projects/batman/analysis/pupillator/hrv_[yymmdd-HHMMSS]`, where 
`[yymmdd-HHMMSS]` is the date when the feature extraction was started.


## Aggregate results across files

The code above extracts HRV features for every relevant data file and 
stores them in separate text files. In order to aggregate all those into a
single text file you need to run:

````matlab
% The directory generated by pupillator.hrv.main
inputDir = '/data1/projects/batman/analysis/pupillator/hrv_[yymmdd-HHMMSS]'

% The name of the output text file (without file extension)
outputFile = 'pvt_features' 

pupillator.hrv.aggregate(inputDir, outputFile)
````
